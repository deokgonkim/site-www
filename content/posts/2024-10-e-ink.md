## Bought E-Ink display

First of all, I tried to search the reference with `despi c097 esp8266` to see the cabling between esp8266 and the driver board.

Ahhh... there is no reference.

What should I do? I visit, the [product page](https://www.good-display.com/product/519.html) but the page only provides technical specification and schematics.
I just want to run a `MicroPython` code to display. (I found, after a successful result, this is not that kind of simple, like turning on the led)

I re-visited the product page of Aliexpress. there is! a product demo code.

I have `wemos d1 mini` so, I downloaded `blabla-ESP8266 sample code`.

It is a arduino code. not a micopython code..

Connect the cables that found in the arduino code,

There is two more connector that is not specified in the code (SCK and SDI).
What I can do is to ask GPT.

(first, i mistakenly connected mosi? or miso? to SDI, after changing it, it finally worked.)

**FINALLY**

the display shows the demo screen!
